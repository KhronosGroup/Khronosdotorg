# Khronos.org Website Community pages

We believe the true usefulness of Khronos Technology goes beyond the spec itself; it is an ecosystem of tools, documentation, and resources contributed by the community. You are encouraged to [get involved](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Khronosdotorg)!

### API
The pages under API include partials from the API landing pages on Khronos.org. For example, the [OpenCL](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Khronosdotorg/api/opencl) folder contains the complete Resources page and the information in the Bluebox.

If you find a mistake, or would like to contribute a resource to any of the resource.md pages, Please submit a pull request with your update.

Feel free to use the Issues tracker if you are unsure of something, or find a mistake that you are unable to fix in a pull request.

CMSoft's color tracking case study presents a technique that is robust to motion-blur and that can perform real-time tracking thanks to OpenCL acceleration. Source code is provided showing how to implement a flashlight mouse, i.e., how to use the webcam and a flashlight to perform mouse movement and clicking.

However, it is necessary to process large amounts of data in real time in order to implement such intelligent systems. CMSoft brings a tutorial on how to create a C# framework to capture Microsoft Kinect sensor data and transfer it to an OpenCL GPU Device, thus enabling the development of software that can potentially process Kinect data hundreds of times faster when compared to pure CPU processing.
